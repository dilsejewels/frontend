                <p style={{ color: "#000" }}>
                  It all began in Surat City, where Anubh and Slisha
                  Kankariya fell in love against the backdrop of the city’s
                  energy and charm. When it came time to find the perfect
                  engagement ring, they realized how overwhelming, confusing,
                  and outdated the process felt. Determined to create something
                  better, they set out to build a simpler, more transparent
                  experience — one that matched the way today’s consumer wants
                  to shop. Dilse Jewels was born out of that vision: to take the
                  stress out of buying lab grown diamond engagement rings to
                  fine jewelry and replace it Dilse Jewels, confidence, and joy.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  More than 10 years later, Dilse Jewels has evolved into a
                  brand shaped by modern values and a deep appreciation for
                  timeless yet ornate design. Inspired by Surat’s vibrancy
                  and elegance, the brand combines advanced technology with
                  artisanal craftsmanship to create jewelry that is both
                  personal and unique — jewelry that honors tradition while
                  speaking to the style and spirit of today.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In 2024, we proudly opened our flagship showroom in SoHo, New
                  York, where clients can experience our jewelry in person and
                  enjoy the same personal, guided experience that defines our
                  brand.
