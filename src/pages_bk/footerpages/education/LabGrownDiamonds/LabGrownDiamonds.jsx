                    Lab created diamonds are more affordable in comparison to
                    natural diamonds. You can expect to pay 15% to 30% less on a
                    lab diamond than you would on a mined diamond. This price
                    difference is because mined diamonds go through a longer
                    supply chain and require more costly resources.

                    Both natural and lab diamonds require carbon, and intense
                    heat and high pressure to grow. While mined diamonds form
                    within the Earth, lab grown diamonds are made in an
                    environment with cutting-edge equipment that mirrors the
                    Earth’s mantle conditions. Therefore, no mining deposits are

                <span>
                  When someone purchases a diamond, the consumer should be
                  knowledgable whether their diamond is natural or lab grown.
                  Many might think that lab created diamonds are not real, but
                  that is false. Lab grown, lab created, or man made diamonds
                  are the hardest substance known to man (with mined diamonds).
                  These kind of diamonds have the same visual, physical, and
                  chemical features to their natural counterparts. Like natural
                  diamonds, lab created diamonds also require carbon, intense
                  heat, and high pressure to grow.

                    Lab created diamonds are manufactured in a lab by skilled
                    technicians who use a combination of heat and pressure to
                    replicate the growth conditions of a natural diamond within
                    the earth. A diamond seed is used to grow additional layers
                    of diamond. Ultimately, rough lab diamonds are cut into the
                    same shapes as natural diamonds.
